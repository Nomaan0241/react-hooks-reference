/**
 * useRef Hook
 * Accept One Argument as an initial Value.
 *
 * useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.
 * useRef returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to the initial value you provided.
 *
 * On the next renders, useRef will return the same object. You can change its current property to store information and read it later.
 * This might remind you of state, but there is an important difference.
 * Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *      You can store information between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).
 *      Changing it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
 *      The information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).
 *      You can also access the html elements using it.
